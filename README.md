# Project Euler 064 - Odd Period Square Roots

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions.

For example, let us consider &radic;23.

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating.

For conciseness, we use the notation &radic;23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)], to indicate that the
block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.

Exactly four continued fractions, for N &le; 13, have an odd period.

How many continued fractions for N &le; n have an odd period?
